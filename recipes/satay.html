      <li>1/4 cup fish sauce</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced onion</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 2-inch piece of fresh lemon grass</li>
      <li>2 pounds beef top sirloin, trimmed</li>
      <li>4 12-inch long metal skewers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together brown sugar, fish sauce, garlic, onion, oil, soy sauce,
        coriander, ginger, cumin, turmeric, and cayenne pepper in a mixing bowl
        until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bruise lemongrass by hitting it lightly several times with the back of a
        large chef's knife; mince lemongrass and add to marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut beef sirloin into strips about 2 1/2-inches long and 1/8 inch-thick.
        Stir beef into marinade until beef is completely coated, about 1 minute.
        Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 2
        to 4 hours.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>
        Remove beef from marinade and shake off excess marinade. Thread 1/4 of
        the meat onto each metal skewer. Discard remaining marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange skewers on the preheated grill; cook until meat stops sticking
        to the grill, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip skewers and continue cooking until
        meat is well browned and shows grill marks, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Flip
        skewers once more; cook until meat is still slightly pink, about 2
        minutes. Transfer skewers to a platter; let rest for 2 minutes before
        serving.
