      <strong>Burger</strong> is a dish consisting of a round patty of ground
      beef, or sometimes another savory ingredient, that is fried or grilled and
      typically served in a split bun or roll with various condiments and
      toppings.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1/2 cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate</li>
      <li>
        Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add ground beef
        and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.
        Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per
        side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
        the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
