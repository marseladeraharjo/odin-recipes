      <li>4 shallots, sliced</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 pcs ginger, peeled and sliced</li>
      <li>1.5 inch piece galangal, peeled and sliced</li>
      <li>2 serrano chile peppers - steemed, seeded, and sliced</li>
      <li>1 fresno chile pepper - steemed, seeded, and sliced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Korean red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cardamon</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 can full-fat coconut milk</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons tamarind paste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 stalk lemongrass, light part</li>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Cut beef chuck into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>
          Combine shallots, garlic, ginger, galangal, serrano and Fresno chiles,
          salt, red pepper flakes, coriander, turmeric, cardamom, and nutmeg in
          the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until paste is very finely ground,
          stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides with a spatula.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the curry paste. Cook and stir
          until it starts to dry out, then stir in the beef. Add coconut milk,
          tamarind paste, and brown sugar. Stir to combine. Fill up the empty
          can of coconut milk with water and pour it into the pan. Increase heat
          to medium-high; bring to a simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the meantime, bruise lemongrass with the back of your knife. Cut
          into 1- to 2-inch pieces and add to the curry. Reduce heat to medium.
          Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until beef is fork-tender and
          sauce is fully reduced, about 4 hours. Stir more frequently as water
          reduces; add more water or lower the heat if sauce is reducing faster
          than beef is softening.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove lemongrass to serve. For best result, let cool and serve the
          next day.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
